# compile_to_sleep
Have you ever sat and watched your code compile and found yourself drifting off to sleep?  The soothing scrolling of the terminal screen.  The low drone of conversation and typing as your coworkers do far more interesting things than you.  The warmth radiating from your overworked laptop.  The only thing better than this to induce drowsiness is a bottle of whiskey and a chaser of ambien.  Now you can replicate this experience without the frustration of having to recompile your project in actuality and seeing what got fucked up in the last commit!

Simply provide a log of the compilation output you want to view, run the script, and enjoy the warm embrace of sleep.

## Usage
```
python compile_to_sleep.py -f FILENAME -s SPEED
```

Script defaults to a run speed of 0.7 seconds and uses the compilation output from my generic 'hello world' first Phoenix project.
